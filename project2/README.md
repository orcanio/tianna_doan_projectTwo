Love is...

# project overview
“Love is…” is dedicated to the Biblical passage 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. This passage is one of the most popular verses among Christians and even non-Christians because it is a reminder of what we as a community are supposed to act like. However, too many of us act like the complete opposite of it. We discriminate against others based on race, gender, sexuality, physical appearances, religion, and even denomination. Hate is what separates us, which isn’t what Christ would approve of. *Unconditional* love is what brings us together, and we must learn how to put aside our differences to make the world a better place.

# technical overview
This project is rather simple and straightforward to emulate the feeling of reading a physical book. The typeface in use is called IM Fell English, created by Iginio Marini. IM Fell is based on the real-life Fell typefaces from the 17th century. The animations are also very simple with the use of fade-ins to make the transitions look less jarring.
